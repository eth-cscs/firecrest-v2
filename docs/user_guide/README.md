# User Guide

## Authentication
FirecREST authentication follows the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol) standard.

To access most endpoints (see the [API reference](https://eth-cscs.github.io/firecrest-v2/openapi/)), you must provide a JWT authorization token in the `Authorization` header:

!!! example "Authorization header"
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    ```

FirecREST authenticates users by verifying the JWT token’s signature against trusted certificates (see the [configuration](../setup/conf/README.md) section). If the JWT token is valid, FirecREST extracts the `username` or `preferred_username` claim to establish the user's identity and propagate it downstream (e.g., for SSH authentication).

To obtain a JWT token, you need a trusted Identity Provider that supports OAuth2 or OpenID Connect protocols. The FirecREST Docker Compose development environment (see the [Getting Started](../getting_started/README.md) section) includes a preconfigured [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) identity provider.

There are multiple grant flows available to obtain a JWT token. The most common ones are:

### Client Credentials Grant

This grant is used to authenticate an application (client) rather than an individual user. However, since HPC infrastructures typically require usage tracking, it is recommended to create a dedicated client for each user or project and assign a service account owned by the user/project to the client. 

**Important:**
Using the identity provider to associate a user or project with a client offers a secure and flexible way to map HPC internal users to FirecREST credentials:
**client credential ← service account ← user/project**

In this flow, the client submits its `client_id` and `client_secret` directly to the authorization server to obtain an access token and a refresh token.


!!! example "Obtain an access token"
    ```
    curl --request POST \
    --url 'http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/kcrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
    --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data grant_type=client_credentials \
    --data client_id=firecrest-test-client \
    --data client_secret=wZVHVIEd9dkJDh9hMKc6DTvkqXxnDttk
    ```

**Note:** The above `curl` command is configured to work with the provided Docker Compose environment. 

!!! example "Expected output example"
    ```json
    {"access_token":"<token>","expires_in":300,"token_type":"Bearer","scope":"firecrest-v2 profile email"} 
    ```


### Authorization Code Grant

This grant is intended for web applications. The user's browser is redirected (HTTP 302) to the authorization server, which handles authentication (e.g., via username/password, two-factor authentication, etc.).

After successful authentication, the authorization server redirects the browser back to a pre-registered endpoint in the web application, passing an authorization code. The web application then uses its own credentials (`client_id` and `client_secret`) along with the authorization code to request an access token from the authorization server.


## API Reference

### Accessing HTTP RESTful Resources

The FirecREST API follows RESTful design principles, allowing access to the underlying resources through standard HTTP requests.

Each request consists of:

- **Endpoint (URL):** The address of the resource being accessed.
- **Method:** One of `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`, depending on the action.
- **Headers:** Metadata necessary for authorisation.
- **Body:** The request payload in JSON format.

Below is a quick overview of the methods:

| Method  | Description  |
|---------|-------------|
| `GET`   | Retrieves resources |
| `POST`  | Creates resources  |
| `PUT`   | Updates resources  |
| `DELETE`| Deletes resources  |

The request body format is specific to each call, the full list of available API calls and requests can be found here: **[API reference](https://eth-cscs.github.io/firecrest-v2/openapi/)**.


### Response Structure

Each FirecREST API response consists of:

- **Status Code:** Indicates the outcome of the request.
- **Headers:** Metadata related to the response.
- **Body:** The response data in JSON format.

Below is an overview of HTTP status codes and their meanings:

| Code  | Category        | Description  |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1xx   | Informational  | Communicates protocol-level information |
| 2xx   | Success        | Indicates the request was successfully processed |
| 3xx   | Redirection    | Instructs the client to take additional action |
| 4xx   | Client Error   | Indicates an issue with the request sent by the client |
| 5xx   | Server Error   | Indicates an issue on the server's side |

### Resource Groups

FirecREST API endpoints are categorized into three groups:

| Group       | URL Prefix       | Description |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Status**   | `/status/...`    | Provides status information about FirecREST and underlying resources |
| **Compute**  | `/compute/...`   | Grants access to the job scheduler |
| **Filesystem** | `/filesystem/...` | Provides access to the filesystem |

### Targeting Systems

A single FirecREST instance can manage multiple HPC systems. Most endpoints require specifying which system to access by including the system name in the endpoint path.

For example:

!!! example "Endpoint path"
    ```plaintext
    /compute/{system_name}/jobs
    ```

The `{system_name}` should correspond to the cluster name provided in the FirecREST configuration.  Refer to the [configuration](../setup/conf/README.md) section for details.


### Full API Endpoints List

The complete list of FirecREST API endpoints is available here:  **[API reference](https://eth-cscs.github.io/firecrest-v2/openapi/)**

## Synchronous and Asynchronous Calls

Most FirecREST endpoints operate synchronously, meaning that the invoked operation is completed before a response is provided. All synchronous responses have a fixed timeout of 5 seconds. If the operation cannot be completed within this time limit, an error is returned.

A limited set of filesystem-specific operations are executed asynchronously. These calls are non-blocking, and a jobId is returned. It is the user’s responsibility to track the status of the remote job and retrieve the result upon completion.


All asynchronous endpoints are located under  `/transfer` and follow this path structure:

!!! example "Asynchronous transfers endpoint"
    ```
    /filesystem/{system_name}/transfer/...
    ```

## File transfer

FirecREST provides two methods for transferring files:
- Small files (up to 5MB by [default](../setup/conf/README.md)) can be uploaded or downloaded directly.
- Large files must first be transferred to a staging storage system (e.g., S3) before being moved to their final location on the HPC filesystem.

Small file transfer endpoints:
 - `/filesystem/{system_name}/ops/download`
 - `/filesystem/{system_name}/ops/upload`

 Large file transfer endpoints:
 - `/filesystem/{system_name}/transfer/download`
 - `/filesystem/{system_name}/transfer/upload`

### Downloading Large Files

When requesting a large file download, FirecREST returns a download URL and a jobId. Once the remote job is completed, the user can retrieve the file using the provided URL.

[Detailed example.](file_transfer_bash/README.md)

## File Transfer with .NET

## FirecREST SDK

[PyFirecREST](https://github.com/eth-cscs/pyfirecrest) is a Python library designed to simplify the implementation of FirecREST clients.

### Installation
To install PyFirecREST, run:

!!! example "Install `pyfirecrest`"
    ```bash 
    $ python3 -m pip install pyfirecrest
    ```

For more details, visit the [official documentation page](https://pyfirecrest.readthedocs.io).

#### List files example

!!! example "List files with `pyfirecrest`"
    ```python
    import firecrest as fc

    class MyAuthorizationClass:
        def get_access_token(self):
            return <TOKEN>

    client = fc.v2.Firecrest(firecrest_url=<firecrest_url>, authorization=MyAuthorizationClass())

    files = client.list_files("cluster", "/home/test_user")
    print(files)

    ```
